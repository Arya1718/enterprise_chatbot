Tata companies have consistently adhered to the values and ideals articulated by the Founder 
for over 150 years. The Tata Code of Conduct was first formalized by Mr Ratan Tata. It articulates the Group’s values and ideals that guide and govern the conduct of our companies as well as our colleagues in all matters relating to business. Today, the Code is a bedrock on which we base our individual, as well as leadership commitments to core Tata values. 
The Tata Code of Conduct outlines our commitment to each of our stakeholders, including the 
communities in which we operate, and is our guiding light when we are sometimes faced with business dilemmas that leave us at ethical crossroads. The Code is also dynamic in that it has been periodically refreshed in order to remain contemporary and contextual to the changes in law and regulations. However it remains unaltered at its core. 
Our stellar reputation and success as a business entity has been defined by the powerful 
commitment and adherence to the core values and principles expressed in this Code, by all our employees, directors and partners. I trust every Tata colleague and Tata company will continue to not only comply with the laws and regulations that govern our business interests around the world, but will continue to set new standards of ethical conduct that will generate deep respect and inspire emulation by others.

Business, as I have seen it, places one great demand on you;  
it needs you to impose a framework of ethics, values, fairness  
and objectivity on yourself at all times. It is not easy to do this;  
you cannot impose it on yourself forcibly because it has to 
become an integral part of you.

I do not think anyone was on par with Jamsetji as an industrial visionary. 
But that is not the sole reason why I have been an admirer of Jamsetji. 
The major reason was his sense of values, sterling values, which he 
imparted to this group. If someone were to ask me, what holds the 
Tata companies together, more than anything else, I would say it is our 
shared ideals and values which we have inherited from Jamsetji Tata.

 O
ur Board of Directors shall consider for 
adoption policies and guidelines periodically formulated by Tata Sons and circulated to group companies.
  y ou ar e in the process of selecting potential vendors for an IT project in our company. In the 
final shortlist of two companies, one is a new start-up with limited references and a lower price-quotation, while the other is a Tata company with thirty years of implementation experience and good references, but a marginally higher quote for the same job.  With all other parameters of choice being nearly equal, which company should you select for the job?  
  W hile price is undoubtedly an important criterion for decision making, it is clearly not the only one 
to be evaluated. You may also need to consider good customer references, proven track record and shared value systems in order to decide on your IT partner. 
  you ar e in the process of selecting potential vendors for a project. one of the thr ee finalists  
is a group company. In reviewing the final proposals, you rank the group company second out of the three proposals based on pricing and total cost of ownership, and select the  first-ranked vendor. Is this the right decision?  
  Y es. You should select the vendor that, on its own merits, is the vendor that is most appropriate for 
your company’s requirements.  You should not select a group company only because of its affiliation. 
A Q&1. W e seek to cooperate with our group

I do not do wha
t I am told, I could lose my job. Should I do it? 
  No. Breaking the law is never an option. Discuss the situation with your supervisor to be certain that  
you both understand the facts. If your concerns are not resolved, contact a higher level supervisor, 
the E
thics Counsellor, the Legal department or report them via the company’s confidential reporting 
system, if available. 
  I f eel that my supervisor is treating me unfairly for reporting a concern to the Ethics 
Counsellor. What should I do?
  Retaliation against anyone who raises a concern is a violation of the Code. You should therefore promptly report this action of your supervisor to the Ethics Counsellor or the MD/CEO of your company or via the company’s confidential reporting system, if available.
