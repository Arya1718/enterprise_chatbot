For over 100 years, the Tata group has been led by visionaries who have stayed
true to the vision of the founder, Jamsetji Tata.
A vision that placed the greater good of society at par with business growth.
A vision that put into practice pioneering social initiatives that changed the
way responsible business was run.
And a vision that brought into the group a strong social conscience.
TCOC_Booklet_Revised 27Mar2017 Final.indd 4 3/27/17 2:26 PMWe do not claim to be more unselfish, more generous or more philanthropic
than other people. But we think we started on sound and straightforward
business principles, considering the interests of the shareholders our own, and
the health and welfare of the employees, the sure foundation of our success.

Tata companies have consistently adhered to the values and ideals articulated by the Founder
for over 150 years. The Tata Code of Conduct was first formalized by Mr Ratan Tata. It articulates
the Group’s values and ideals that guide and govern the conduct of our companies as well as our
colleagues in all matters relating to business. Today, the Code is a bedrock on which we base our
individual, as well as leadership commitments to core Tata values.
The Tata Code of Conduct outlines our commitment to each of our stakeholders, including the
communities in which we operate, and is our guiding light when we are sometimes faced with
business dilemmas that leave us at ethical crossroads. The Code is also dynamic in that it has
been periodically refreshed in order to remain contemporary and contextual to the changes in
law and regulations. However it remains unaltered at its core.
Our stellar reputation and success as a business entity has been defined by the powerful
commitment and adherence to the core values and principles expressed in this Code, by all our
employees, directors and partners. I trust every Tata colleague and Tata company will continue
to not only comply with the laws and regulations that govern our business interests around the
world, but will continue to set new standards of ethical conduct that will generate deep respect
and inspire emulation by others.

oUR CoRE PRINCIPLES
The Tata philosophy of management has always been, and is today more than
ever, that corporate enterprises must be managed not merely in the interests
of their owners, but equally in those of their employees, of the consumers of
their products, of the local community and finally of the country as a whole.

such a situation would significantly hinder this candidate’s ability to cope with the job

the job. All eligible candidates should be provided with equal opportunity to demonstrate or justify
that they can cope with the travel requirements of the job. Being a single parent cannot be a ground

RemembeR…
As a general rule, we may accept gifts or hospitality from a business associate, only if such a gift:
• has modest value and does not create a perception (or an implied obligation) that the giver
is entitled to preferential treatment of any kind;
• would not influence, or appear to influence, our ability to act in the best interest of our company;
• would not embarrass our company or the giver if disclosed publicly.
The following gifts are never appropriate and should never be given or accepted:
• gifts of cash or gold or other precious metals, gems or stones;
• gifts that are prohibited under applicable law;
• gifts in the nature of a bribe, payoff, kickback or facilitation payment*;
• gifts that are prohibited by the gift giver’s or recipient’s organisation; and
• gifts in the form of services or other non-cash benefits (e.g. a promise of employment).

Q&A
our company has recently announced the launch of a new business initiative. In connection
with this, your friend who is a journalist with a leading business newspaper has asked you
to provide some information that he could cover in his forthcoming article. He has promised
not to quote you, or reveal your identity. Should you be giving him this information?
No. You should not be sharing information of this nature with the media, even if it is assured that the
source would remain anonymous. Only authorised personnel in the company are permitted to speak
to the media and provide information of this nature.
our company has a “Use of Social media” policy that lays down the “dos and don’ts” for use of
social media even if you may access such media on your own time. Why is there such a policy?
External communication is a serious matter. It must be carefully managed because information put
out with reference to our company or its businesses needs to be clear, truthful and not violate any
undertakings we have given to other parties. In each business there are managers nominated to authorise
and make different types of statements to the outside world. These managers should be consulted about
any request for information you may receive or information you think we should give out.
In using social media, in particular blogs or social networking sites, you should exercise great caution
while talking about our company or the business we do. It may feel like you are chatting with
friends or expressing a personal opinion but even while doing so you cannot share any confidential
information of our company.

We must respect the property rights of others by never misusing their assets, intellectual property
or trade secrets, including the copying or downloading of unauthorised software, trademarks,

Q&A
you are in a relationship with a colleague who has been recently moved into your team and
would now be reporting to you. What should you do?
Romantic or close personal relationships with another employee where a reporting relationship
exists and one is responsible for evaluating the other’s performance, is likely to create a conflict of
interest. In such a situation, you would need to report the potential conflict to your supervisor.
your company is submitting a proposal to a company in which you were previously employed.
you have confidential information pertaining to your previous employer, which you believe
will help your present employer in winning the contract. Should you share this information?
No. You should not share this information with your company since it relates to confidential
information of a third party. Your company respects its employees’ duty to protect confidential
information that they may have relating to their previous employers.
you are the purchasing manager in the procurement department of your company. you

No. You should not accept the invitation in this instance. Since you are in a key decision-making role
for the tender, any unusual benefit that you receive could be perceived as an inducement that could
compromise your objectivity.

you are the Regional Sales manager of our company. you have become a member of an
“informal group”, on an instant messaging service, whose members are the regional sales
heads of our company’s competitors. The administrator of the group has requested an
in-person meeting to informally discuss market conditions and brainstorm on “pricing
strategy” from an industry perspective. What should you do?
Any meeting with competitors, especially to discuss “pricing strategy”, could be an attempt to
promote an anti-competitive practice or manipulate prices. You should respond by declining this
invitation and exiting the “informal group”. You should also report this incident to your supervisor
and your Legal department.
you are attending a customer meeting with a colleague, and your colleague makes an
untruthful statement about the company’s services. What should you do?
You should assist your colleague in correcting the inaccuracy during the meeting if possible. If this is
not possible, raise the issue with your colleague after the meeting to enable him/her or the company
to correct any misrepresentation made to the customer.
While working on a customer project, you receive a call from your colleague. He used
to manage that customer account before you took over his role. He recalls that he had
worked with the customer on developing a new ordering system which he thinks would
be beneficial for another customer and requests you to send him the project details.
What should you do?
You must not share this information without specific approval of the customer; you are not permitted
to use a customer’s assets, including software, for another customer or for any personal use.

Business, as I have seen it, places one great demand on you;
it needs you to impose a framework of ethics, values, fairness
and objectivity on yourself at all times. It is not easy to do this;
you cannot impose it on yourself forcibly because it has to
become an integral part of you.

I do not think anyone was on par with Jamsetji as an industrial visionary.
But that is not the sole reason why I have been an admirer of Jamsetji.
The major reason was his sense of values, sterling values, which he
imparted to this group. If someone were to ask me, what holds the
Tata companies together, more than anything else, I would say it is our
shared ideals and values which we have inherited from Jamsetji Tata.

Q&A
you are in the process of selecting potential vendors for an IT project in our company. In the
final shortlist of two companies, one is a new start-up with limited references and a lower
price-quotation, while the other is a Tata company with thirty years of implementation
experience and good references, but a marginally higher quote for the same job. With all
other parameters of choice being nearly equal, which company should you select for the job?
W hile price is undoubtedly an important criterion for decision making, it is clearly not the only one
to be evaluated. You may also need to consider good customer references, proven track record and
shared value systems in order to decide on your IT partner.
you are in the process of selecting potential vendors for a project. one of the three finalists
is a group company. In reviewing the final proposals, you rank the group company second
out of the three proposals based on pricing and total cost of ownership, and select the
first-ranked vendor. Is this the right decision?
Y es. You should select the vendor that, on its own merits, is the vendor that is most appropriate for
your company’s requirements. You should not select a group company only because of its affiliation.

Q&A
my supervisor has asked me to do something which I believe may be illegal. I am afraid if
I do not do what I am told, I could lose my job. Should I do it?
No. Breaking the law is never an option. Discuss the situation with your supervisor to be certain that
you both understand the facts. If your concerns are not resolved, contact a higher level supervisor,
the Ethics Counsellor, the Legal department or report them via the company’s confidential reporting
system, if available.
I feel that my supervisor is treating me unfairly for reporting a concern to the Ethics
Counsellor. What should I do?
Retaliation against anyone who raises a concern is a violation of the Code. You should therefore
promptly report this action of your supervisor to the Ethics Counsellor or the MD/CEO of your
company or via the company’s confidential reporting system, if available.

SPeAK UP…
If you are unsure whether a particular action you are about to take is consistent with the principles
set forth in the Code, ask yourself:
• Could it directly or indirectly endanger someone or cause them injury?
• Is it illegal/unlawful or out of line with our policies and procedures?
• Does my conscience reject it? Does it conflict with my personal values?
• Would I feel uncomfortable if the story appeared in the media? Would it shame my company,
spouse, partner, parent or child?
• Does it ‘feel’ wrong?
If the answer to any of these questions is “Yes”, please stop and consult your reporting manager,
the Ethics Counsellor, the Human Resource department, the Legal department or any member of
the senior management team, to assist you in making the decision.
